Hand Evaluation Functions Documentation:

These functions evaluate a Texas Hold'em hand against standard poker hand rankings. Each function accepts a list of Card objects representing a player's hand (including community cards) and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether the hand meets the specific criteria (e.g., is a flush, straight, etc.). The second element is a list of Card objects (`sorted_hand`), which is sorted based on the significance of the cards in forming the hand rank. The `sorted_hand` places the most significant cards at the front (those that form the hand rank, such as a pair or three of a kind) and then follows with the remaining cards in descending rank order to facilitate tie-breaking and hand comparison. These functions are designed to work in a sequence, checking from the highest hand rank to the lowest, allowing for an efficient determination of the hand's rank in the game.
